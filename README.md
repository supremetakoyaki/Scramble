# Scramble
Scramble is a NEO: The World Ends with You save editor.

It works for save files for versions 1.00 and 1.01 of the game.

# How to use
You need a decrypted save file of the game. This save file weighs about 3.15MB.
After that, you can [download the latest release](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble/releases/) and you're ready to go.

Note that you need the [.NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) to run the editor! 
I recommend running it on Windows 10 or 11. But Mac works fine too.

# How to get your save file
- If you have a Switch, you'll need to first be [running CFW](https://switch.homebrew.guide/) and then use a homebrew app to get the save file. For example, I use [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases/) most of the time. 
- In case you're running the Switch version of the game on an emulator such as Yuzu or Ryujinx, decrypted saves are in your user profile folder, typically named "user". Look for a 3.15MB file called "gamesave" without extension.
- If you have a PS4, I'm afraid I can't help you... yet. You could request the Save Wizard folks to enable Advanced Mode for NEO:TWEWY. That way you could get access to the decrypted PS4 save.

# Features
Right now, Scramble can do the following:
- Edit any of the 10 save slots of the game.
- Edit your game difficulty, experience, current level, money and FP.
- Edit your character stats.
- Edit your pin inventory.
- Edit your clothing inventory.
- Hide character names that you haven't seen or unlocked yet (they will be shown as "Spoiler").
- Change the UI and game data's text to any of these languages: English, Japanese, Spanish and French.

There will be more features coming in the future, so stay tuned!

I love TWEWY so much and I'm really happy with the sequel. I datamined absolutely everything from the game and I'm determined to make this save editor user-friendly and pleasing to the eye.
Thank you for reading up to here!
